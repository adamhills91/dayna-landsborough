            <p class="fade-in-and-up">Counselling is a talking therapy, it provides a safe and confidential space for
              you to bring what you need to and talk through with a trained professional.</p>
            <p class="fade-in-and-up">This could be holistic and exploratory, goal orientated and practical, a place for
              self understanding and awareness, or anything in between.</p>
            <p class="fade-in-and-up">Counsellors do not prescribe medication or give advice, instead help you to find

            <h4>Exploratory</h4>
            <p>This can be long term or short term. This type of session can be a place for you to explore and
              understand yourself a little more. You may have a general goal in mind, you may not - either is absolutely
              fine.</p>

            <p>We can work together to develop self awareness, to talk through something you are going through/have been
              through, or be a space for you to come to for whatever you may need. This fits the idea of the more
              typical talking therapy style.</p>

            <h4>Goal Specific Programme</h4>
            <p>This programme is set to 6 sessions and is designed to support you to manage a specific goal. It includes
              the standard 1 hour sessions weekly or every other week, with the addition of two 20 minute phone call
              check ins after the sessions, staggered to best support your progress moving forward.</p>

            <p>Together we will highlight where you feel you are struggling and set a plan to develop techniques and
              skills to manage situations in the future.</p>

            <p>This includes personalised and curated digital workbooks for you to keep and work through during and
              after sessions. This is best suited for specific work, for example managing anxiety inducing situations or
              emotional regulation.</p>

            <h4>Flexi-session</h4>
            <p>This type of session gives you a more flexible approach to a counselling session, you are free to use
              anywhere between 1 hour and 1 1/2 hours. </p>

            <p>Sometimes we can notice that it takes us a little bit of time to get into what we want to bring into the
              session and when we get there we run out of time. </p>

        <p class="fade-in-and-up">I understand that this is a key element to the counselling work. I am open to hear the
          difficulties you may be experiencing with a caring and non-judgemental view, we're all human and life an be
          hard.</p>

        <p class="fade-in-and-up">There are times when we may need to talk around the subject of exclusions to
          confidentiality; where there may be immediate or serious harm to yourself or another, this would be something
          we would aim to discuss and work through together. At the end of the day the choice lies with you but I do
          work alongside my own clinical supervisor to ensure mental capacity and safety to make your own choice.</p>

              psychotherapist</strong> trained at The Devon and Cornwall Counselling Hub. I have a <strong>Level 5 in
              Psychotherapeutic Counselling at Lifetime Counselling</strong>. Alongside my practice, I support
            individuals at a local mental health charity, offering DBT-style one-on-one assistance.</p>

          <p class="fade-in-and-up">My journey into counselling was deeply influenced by my own positive experiences
            with personal therapy. It provided a judgment-free space where I could be fully myself, explore my identity,
            and navigate challenges. This personal growth and the ability to manage overwhelming feelings during my
            university years were pivotal. The kindness, humour, understanding, and care I received are elements I
            incorporate into my practice, recognising that humour's healing power varies among individuals. I aim to
            tailor our sessions to best suit your needs and goals.</p>

          <p class="fade-in-and-up">I am committed to fostering a safe space for the LGBTQ+ community, acknowledging the
            global challenges and emotions they face, including fear. <strong>Ensuring therapy is accessible and
