              <p class="fade-in-and-up">This could be holistic and exploratory, goal orientated and practical, a place for self understanding and awareness, or anything in between.</p>

              <h4>Exploratory</h4>
              <p>This can be long term or short term. This type of session can be a place for you to explore and understand yourself a little more. You may have a general goal in mind, you may not - either is absolutely fine.</p>

              <p>We can work together to develop self awareness, to talk through something you are going through/have been through, or be a space for you to come to for whatever you may need. This fits the idea of the more typical talking therapy style.</p>

              <h4>Goal Specific Programme</h4>
              <p>This programme is set to 6 sessions and is designed to support you to manage a specific goal. It includes the standard 1 hour sessions weekly or every other week, with the addition of two 20 minute phone call check ins after the sessions, staggered to best support your progress moving forward.</p>

              <p>Together we will highlight where you feel you are struggling and set a plan to develop techniques and skills to manage situations in the future.</p>

              <p>This includes personalised and curated digital workbooks for you to keep and work through during and after sessions. This is best suited for specific work, for example managing anxiety inducing situations or emotional regulation.</p>

              <h4>Flexi-session</h4>
              <p>This type of session gives you a more flexible approach to a counselling session, you are free to use anywhere between 1 hour and 1 1/2 hours. </p>

              <p>Sometimes we can notice that it takes us a little bit of time to get into what we want to bring into the session and when we get there we run out of time. </p>

          <p class="fade-in-and-up">There are times when we may need to talk around the subject of exclusions to confidentiality; where there may be immediate or serious harm to yourself or another, this would be something we would aim to discuss and work through together. At the end of the day the choice lies with you but I do work alongside my own clinical supervisor to ensure mental capacity and safety to make your own choice.</p>

            <p class="fade-in-and-up">My name is Dayna and I am a qualified <strong>Integrative Counsellor and psychotherapist</strong> trained at The Devon and Cornwall Counselling Hub. I'm currently advancing my practice with a <strong>Level 5 in Psychotherapeutic Counselling at Lifetime Counselling</strong>. Alongside my practice, I support individuals at a local mental health charity, offering DBT-style one-on-one assistance.</p>

            <p class="fade-in-and-up">My journey into counselling was deeply influenced by my own positive experiences with personal therapy. It provided a judgment-free space where I could be fully myself, explore my identity, and navigate challenges. This personal growth and the ability to manage overwhelming feelings during my university years were pivotal. The kindness, humour, understanding, and care I received are elements I incorporate into my practice, recognising that humour's healing power varies among individuals. I aim to tailor our sessions to best suit your needs and goals.</p>

            <p class="fade-in-and-up">I am committed to fostering a safe space for the LGBTQ+ community, acknowledging the global challenges and emotions they face, including fear. <strong>Ensuring therapy is accessible and welcoming for everyone</strong>, including sex workers and those in adult industries, is a cornerstone of my practice. <strong>My approach is always open, accepting, and non-judgmental</strong>.</p>
