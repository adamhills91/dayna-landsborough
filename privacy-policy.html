          <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
          <p>I understand how important your privacy is. I take care to maintain your confidentiality in accordance with current data protection laws (GDPR, 2018) and the ethical guidelines of BACP. These guidelines have been set up to protect your confidential material and ensure that your therapist always conducts themselves with professionalism and integrity.</p>
          <p>In order to provide you with the best service possible, I will hold your personal contact details and records of your therapy sessions. Please find below important information about how this information will be held and used.</p>

          <div class="policy">
            <h2>Your personal information</h2>
            <p>At the point of booking your initial consultation with me, you will be asked for your personal contact information, for example your name, address, email address and telephone number and you may also choose to share details of the issues you are looking for help with.</p>
            <p>Your contact information is stored securely in a locked file on a locked computer, only accessed and used by me.</p>
            <p>Please note that I will need to keep a record of your name and client reference number for 5 years after the end of your therapy, so that we can respond effectively to any potential requests regarding your clinical notes and treatment and as required by my insurance. </p>
            <p>I will never pass on your contact details to any third party organisations for the purposes of sales, marketing or research and will never use your personal data for any purposes other than the administration of the counselling service I providing to you i.e. to arrange, cancel and rearrange appointments and collect payment for sessions.</p>

            <p>I keep notes of each session. These are anonymised and are stored in a locked filing cabinet or within a password protected file within a password protected private computer. These notes are for my use only and help to keep a track of everything that is being discussed. In line with industry guidelines, these notes will be kept securely for 5 years after your therapy comes to an end. After this time, they will be confidentially destroyed.</p>
            <p>If your sessions are paid for or arranged via a third party, (e.g. your employer, a friend, or a family member), other than payment requests, invoices or receipts your counselling information will not be shared.
